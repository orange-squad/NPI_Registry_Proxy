# NPPES NPI Registry Proxy

Because the NPPES NPI Registry is not set up properly, you will get CORS errors if you try to make API calls from a front-end application.  One way around this issue is to use a proxy server.

This is a simple proxy that can be used to make requests to the NPI Registry.  It should be modified to suit your particular usecase.

It is hosted here: https://npi-registry-proxy.herokuapp.com/

## Example usage

```bash
